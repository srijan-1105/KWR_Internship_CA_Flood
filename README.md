# Cellular Automata Flood Model (KWR Internship)

This repository contains code and experiments developed during a research
internship at KWR Water Research Institute.

The work includes:
- Python-based Cellular Automata (CA) flood model
- Validation against EA benchmark datasets (Test 1 and Test 2)
- Comparison against Delft3D-FM results using a synthetic SWE–GNN dataset
- PyTorch implementation with GPU batch parallelization

## Structure
- notebooks/local  → run locally
- notebooks/colab  → run on Google Colab (GPU)
- data             → datasets (added manually)
- results          → outputs
